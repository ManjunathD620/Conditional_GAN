# Conditional_GAN
The GAN architecture consists of two components called Generator and Discriminator. In simple words, the role of the generator is to generate new data (numbers, images, etc.) which is as close/similar to the dataset that is provided as input, and the role of the discriminator is to differ between generated data and real input data.

Conditional GAN was developed by modifying the GAN architecture by adding the label y as a parameter to the input of the generator and try to generate the corresponding data point. It also adds labels to the discriminator input to distinguish real data better.<b> Conditional-GAN which allows us to generate the data as per the required label.</b>
